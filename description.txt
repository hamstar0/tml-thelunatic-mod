This mod adds one important missing component to Terraria: A central motivation. Namely, hurrying to save the world. Literally.

Incidentally (maybe), please welcome our friendly newcomer to the town roster: The Lunatic. Who is he? Is he a he? Why does he want masks? Will his bake sale idea ever take off? Is that unearthly increasing orange sky tinge normal? Play this mod to find out!

If for some reason you're finding the struggle to quell those pesky seismic tremors a bit much (or else too little), feel free to tone things down in the config file, found in 'Documents/My Games/Terraria/ModLoader/Mod Configs/The Lunatic Config.json'.

...did I mention there's an excellent, one-of-a-kind reward waiting for you at the end of your quest? No cheating!


Important:
- You'll need a relatively fresh world to play this. The Lunatic won't spawn if you've killed any of the main bosses.
- You'll get warnings before the end comes. Talk to the Lunatic for more information.
- Once time runs out, the apocalypse begins. It is permanent for any given world.
- Protip: Try to keep this guy safe. Like any town NPC, there's no telling when he'll return, if you don't.
